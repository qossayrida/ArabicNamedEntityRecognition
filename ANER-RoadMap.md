# ArabicNamedEntityRecognition

This file contains the resources for performing **Arabic Named Entity Recognition (NER)**. NER is the process of identifying and classifying named entities such as persons, organizations, locations, dates, and other entities in Arabic text. This project focuses on building models for Arabic NER using various approaches, including traditional machine learning models and state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.

## Project Overview

### Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes Arabic text normalization, tokenization, and lemmatization.
- **Model Architectures**:
- **Evaluation Metrics**: 
- **Pre-trained Models**: 

### Project Structure:
- `data/`: Contains the datasets used for training and testing (instructions on obtaining datasets are provided).
- `models/`: Implementation of various NER models.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model development.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
- `results/`: Stores model evaluation results and performance metrics.

## Datasets

- **ANERCorp**: Arabic Named Entity Corpus.
- **AQMAR**: Dataset for Arabic Question Answering and NER.
- **ACE Arabic**: Annotated named entities in Arabic.
